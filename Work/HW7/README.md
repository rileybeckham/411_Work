HW7- This homework was slightly more time consuming only because I had to figure out how to display the image in the object but once it was figured out for the first object the other 4 objects were straightforward. I didn’t do any CSS on this homework, and if I were to add CSS, I would center the whole display and make sure the images were the same size. However, I do believe I have satisfied all the requirements for homework 7. I found some cool jpgs on a free site, which didn’t offer very much information about the images, but they were cool images. Some of the images were from my phone.
