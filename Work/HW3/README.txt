This weeks on hands work and homework was a bigger load. I finished lesson 4-10 on code academy and that was extremely helpful reminder on java script. This week’s homework was a challenging one because I couldn’t remember how to do a few things with JavaScript that I wanted to do. It also took a fair amount of time to come up with a story, but I got hungry while I was trying to come up with something. I wanted the user to be able to have two button choices every time they chose an option rather than a prompt that checked a string. I was not able to re-render new buttons after a button click, and I am sure it is something I just couldn’t figure out. Otherwise I believe I accomplished all of the tasks assigned!
