HW13-This homework assignment was very new to me. Not only I have never seen threejs before, but I have not used modeling libraries or software really at all in the past. I do believe I was able to get two shapes on the screen ( sphere and square) and then I incorporated a torus model I made on tinkercad. The only thing I really couldnâ€™t figure out was how to change the size and position of the glb. After looking at some examples there seemed to be a lot of ways I could have accomplished the requirements, and some of the projects seems fairly intricate. They reminded me of the old airplane games back in the day where it would simulate real air flight and you had to see if you could fly and land the plane.
