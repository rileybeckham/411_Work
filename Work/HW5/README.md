HW5 – This homework was a start to a matching game we are going to make. This assignment was tasked with generating the back of the cards, randomly assigning the front of the cards. Displaying the back of the card to screen and when they are clicked on, they reveal the front of the card. There can only be two of each picture, so they have a match, and I did so with arrays, loops, and random math function. This was a fun assignment, that helped demonstrate some of the modularity that you can use when you take advantage of scripts and functions. I was starting to get a little lost in all the TableCell divs and wasn’t quite sure the most intuitive way to represent that in the Main HTML file. Overall it was a very fun assignment with an extremely helpful example provided for us. I ended up reusing pictures from past assignments for efficiency, so I hope they make sense in this context. In react I can make functions that return HTML or in reacts case JSX, can you do the same thing with plain JavaScript. Can you make a JavaScript function that implements HTML?
