HW11- This was a tricky homework for me because I was not able to identity an easy error. My class circle had a variable name the same as a getter and was causing an infinite loop. After that was pointed out to me everything else was working very well. The only bugs I notice is the circles are not filling with the correct color, and the collision detection for the circles requires the play to hit the center of the circle, but that is because of the collision detection function. This homework gave me a run for my money, but I really did appreciate the game and lessons it taught me.
