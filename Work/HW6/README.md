HW6 – This assignment was much more challenging then the first part just because of the flipImage method that not only dictates when there is a match or not but also keeps score. It took a second to figure out, but it went smoothly after watching your video on your logic behind it. I had an Unspecified error code that kept coming up with trying to use LocalStorage on the browser.  I tried clearing the cache and cookies and I tried clearing the localStorage before I tried to save player info to there. I finally found that there is a bug In Microsoft Edge where LocalStorage isn’t working so when I opened the same code I originally had in google chrome it worked perfectly. If I had more time to spend on this project, I would do much more CSS to this game, but I am satisfied with its functionality.  Overall this was a really cool little game and I am happy we built it for homework!
