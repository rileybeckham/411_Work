HW8- This homework was challenging for me as a computer scientist. Not only the abstract aspect of just having random shapes, words, and images do random things but also because I haven’t made a slide show before and I haven’t used jQuery before. My only goal was to accomplish the requirements declared by the homework pdf. I used a reference for the slide show, and I used a reference for the upside-down triangle. I used fadeTo() to display the upside down triangle but every time the triangle rotated the square re-appeared. I think I was doing this the hard way unnecessarily, but I do believe I satisfied all the requirements. However, this isn’t anything I am proud of. The text fades in and out and toggles by using the button, the slideshow starts when you click anywhere, I believe and the square moves across the screen when clicked on as well. When everything is going it is a lot going on.
