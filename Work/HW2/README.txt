In preparation for homework 2 I completed the 3 lessons from code Academy that was asked of us, and it was a nice reminder on js. This homework assignment wasn’t very challenging to complete but was a necessary introductory to JavaScript for those who don’t have any experience with it. I didn’t have many complications with completing the assignment. It took me awhile to think of my three favorite websites and it took forever for me to come up with my 3 favorite artists. I look forward to seeing what we end up doing using JavaScript.
