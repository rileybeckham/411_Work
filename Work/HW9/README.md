HW9-This homework assignment was difficult for me because I haven’t used jQuery yet and for some reason, I wasn’t able to display a list of colors to the screen using a loop. I had tried using a for loop but for some reason it would display the raw json file when I tried using that method. I could have hard coded a few different colors but that doesn’t show any extra coding skill just shows time, and I put a lot of time into trying to figure out how to loop through the json file successfully. It was annoying because I have done it using the map function before but every time, I tried it displayed the raw json data. Other than that, trouble the rest went smooth, I just made a basic plug in that changes the background to black and the font color to white. It was a nice exercise with ajax and jQuery.
