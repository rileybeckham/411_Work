This week’s assignment was harder than I thought at fist glance. I modified my homework three to look more like what you were expecting and then I started adding choices. Make sure to enter all lower case otherwise it wont work. I was going to use the .toLowerCase() function but I didn’t get around to it. After adding all the logic and choices this program was extensive and the logic had my head confused from time to time. Testing all the cases alone took some a lot of time. Warning: there are a few answers that will force the story to end in a positive or negative way. The difficulty in the project was the amount of different options that had to be accounted for, not necessarily the difficulty of the code itself. As I was finishing this homework I thought to myself “I wonder if there is a better more concise way of doing this”.
