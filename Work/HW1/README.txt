441 HW-1 Readme
The most difficult part of this homework was the additional section that describes something that stands out from your peers. I didn’t take the first half of this course and I am not sure if I fit in with my peers in this course. Instead I took this class to work out my front-end development muscles. I am in my last semester as a computer science student and although this course doesn’t count as computer science credit it satisfies the 2 more credits I need to graduate. I am assuming that is what makes me unique in comparison to my peers in class causing the theme to the last section of the website for homework one.
I had some frustration with relearning some CSS and html but that was welcomed and encouraged. I am in the senior capstone or advanced programming class in the CS department and working on the front end of some software and need some practice. I used a picture one of my good friends Tyler Clawson took as the background picture. I had used one I found online of the walking bridge in Missoula but feared copyright infringement.
