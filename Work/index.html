                <h1>Information About Riley</h1>
                <p>Riley Beckham is a computer science student, and future developer. 
                He looks forward to using the skills he has accumulated from his education, assistant manager customer service experience, and assembly experience into the software engineering workforce.
                These experiences have helped build skills such as software development, management, teamwork, time appropriation, and communication. 
                He is currently building on his software engineering skills and getting experience with front-end development.
                His expected graduation date is May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and a Minor in Mathematics.</p>

                    <h1>Why is Riley Here</h1>
                    <p>
                        Riley is in his last semester of his bachelor’s in science of Computer Science and is looking forward to his career.
                        He is here to work on his font end development and design skills and a computer scientist rather that a media arts student or graphic designer.
                        This class is the last elective credit He needs to satisfy his credit requirements for graduation despite not being a computer science-based class.
                        As computer scientist we tend to put more weight on figuring out the problem rather than demonstrating that problem or solution in an elegant and creative way. 
                        Making this class a great opportunity for Riley to focus on design and front-end implantation.
                        Computer science is beautiful because it bridges the art and design worlds with the math and science world in free and creative way.
